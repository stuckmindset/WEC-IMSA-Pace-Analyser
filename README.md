WEC/IMSA Pace Analyzer
Overview

The WEC/IMSA Pace Analyzer is a Python Streamlit application designed to analyze lap times and performance data from endurance racing events (WEC, IMSA). It helps you quickly evaluate average lap times, top speeds, and driver performance across selected cars, manufacturers, or individual drivers.

The app processes CSV files containing race telemetry, allowing you to:

    Filter laps by car class and selected carsâ€¦        Car

        Team

        Manufacturer

        Average Lap Time

        Laps Used

        Average Top Speed

Disclaimer

This tool provides insight into lap time trends and averages, but should not be taken as a definitive measure of overall car or driver performance. Endurance races include many variables not captured in the dataset, such as tire wear, fuel load, driver fatigue, pit stop strategy, and mechanical issues. Use this app as a guide, not as an exact performance predictor.
